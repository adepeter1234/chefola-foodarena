            CEO Olabiyi Lawal is a serial entrepreneur and the CEO of Food
            Arena. He grew up in Nigeria’s most vibrant city, Lagos. His
            elementary influence was his mum who was into catering. His mum is a
            master of quick dinners whose uncanny ability to combine raw
            ingredients to create a flavourful meal is one he is glad to have
            inherited from her. His varied career after picking up some of his
            culinary skills from his mum included a stint at Kochtas Cousine as
            a food Service and grilling Caterer.
          </p>
          <p>
            These peculiar experiences brought to his understanding the crucial
            need to have a broad and refined international knowledge which he
            was able to pursue further at Istanbul Gelism University, Turkey
            where he studied Gastronomy. After working at the prestigious Krunch
            Restaurant in Istanbul, he moved back to Nigeria. He then went ahead
            for a professional training at the Reddish Chronicles Culinary
            School, Lagos, Nigeria where he studied intercontinental and African
            cuisine from different professionals and graduated on top of the
            class.

            Apart from building on his mother's legacy as a caterer, his over 13 years experience in the food industry serving at different capacities and attending different culinary schools have not only given him a career platform in catering but they have also increased his quest to become more in every possible inches. His dedication to and passion for his craft is second to none.

           In 2022, Ola felt there was a gap in the market to offer fresh, delicious yet approachable “african fussion”, a food he called Purple rice as he practiced this kind of eating in his own home, among and within his family and friends circle before he later introduced it for public consumption. After receiving a wide acceptance by his customers, it became clear to him that he would be able to scale a business with it . Variety is the spice of life.
